1) Copy 'Richard Adams.properties' and use it as a template for your own file of machine specific settings.
2) Rename the file 'user.name'.properties where user.name is  the value of the Java system property user.name.

For tests to run, you may need to add the junit4.4 jar from your eclipse plugin into
the ant classpath (via the classpath tab of the launch configuration).

Running unit tests from ant that use libSBML do not run properly on Windows; this is due to
ant using different classloaders for each junit test class. But runningthem from Eclipse works fine.
